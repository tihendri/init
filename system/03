After you've changed the name using previous command, you need to edit the \"/etc/hosts\" file and replace the previous name with the new name you've entered.
In addition you'll need to replace any other occurrences of the old name with the new name.
You'll need to restart your system for the changes to take effect, however if you don't want to restart, you could run \"/etc/init.d/hostname.sh start\".
