# it's tricky for wsl, we need to find the ip first,
in powershell run \"wsl hostname -I\" to get wsl independent ip.

# then you can enter the command:
ssh username@ip - alternatively you'd use: ssh username@hostname

# the host machine name won't work, only ip

# for a graphical session, only when already in vm through ssh (Debian-specific), you need to run:
startx
